## Overview

I'm using [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org) with custom configurations.

<https://github.com/ZeanQin/starter> is the starter template forked from <https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim> and it contains my custom configurations.

## Setup

Follow the LazyVim [Installation](https://www.lazyvim.org/installation) instructions, except clone the starter template by running `git clone https://github.com/ZeanQin/starter ~/.config/nvim`.

## Manage the configurations

For <https://github.com/ZeanQin/starter>,

- sync the fork to get latest LazyVim changes
- push any custom configurations to the repo
